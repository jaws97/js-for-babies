# 04 — Lesson Blueprint & Visualization Catalog

## Anatomy of every lesson (the 6 parts, in order)

1. **Hook** (2–3 sentences). Why this concept exists — the problem it solves. Never start with syntax.
   > *"Your program calculated the perfect tip. Then the line ended — and the machine forgot it instantly. You need a way to make it remember."* → variables.

2. **Visualize** (the core, 5–12 steps). Code pane + visualization pane, driven by the Stepper. Each step: one line of code highlights, one thing happens in the picture, one short caption explains it. At the pivotal step, a **prediction gate** (pink sticky): "Before you press next — what will `console.log(b)` show?" The learner answers, *then* the reveal plays, then a "why" note appears (whether they were right or wrong).

3. **Under the Hood** (collapsible prose, but not optional in spirit). The accurate, deeper explanation: correct terminology (allocation, binding, coercion, execution context), what the simplification above hid, links to related lessons. This section is why the app never becomes "pretty but shallow."

4. **Play** (1–3 micro-exercises). Interact with the visualization directly: drag a value into a slot, write a selector that lights up the right node, fix a broken snippet, or a 3-question quiz where each answer is *replayed* in the viz rather than just marked right/wrong.

5. **Teach-back** (the mastery gate). "Explain X to a friend who has never coded" — a textarea, saved to the journal. After submitting, a model answer appears for self-comparison, plus the 1–2 analogies the lesson used. This builds the user's own teaching material over time.

6. **Recap** (auto-generated). 2–4 recall cards added to the spaced-recall deck (e.g., "Sketch what memory looks like after `let a = {x:1}; let b = a;`"). Shows which future lessons build on this one.

### Authoring quality checklist (every lesson must pass)
- [ ] One mental model only — anything extra split into its own lesson
- [ ] At least one prediction gate at the point of highest surprise
- [ ] The gotcha (if the topic has one) is celebrated, not buried
- [ ] Under the Hood names the real terminology an interviewer would use
- [ ] Viz is a pure function of step index (scrub back/forward works)
- [ ] Teach-back prompt written; model answer written
- [ ] Verified in the browser at desktop AND ~1280px laptop width

## Visualization component catalog
Reusable components in `src/viz/`. Built once, reused across lessons — consistency **is** pedagogy: when the learner sees the same CallStackTower in Phase 3, Phase 6, and Phase 10, the knowledge compounds.

### Design notes for the two hero visualizations
**`MemoryDiagram`** (the workhorse, built first in M1)
- Two modes: *simple* (Phase 1: labeled boxes on paper) and *heap* (Phase 4+: a stack column of name→slot bindings on the left, a heap cloud of objects on the right, blue-pencil arrows crossing over).
- The Phase 4 "upgrade moment" is scripted: the simple picture literally redraws itself into the accurate one while the caption admits the simplification. This is the app's philosophy in one animation.
- API sketch: `<MemoryDiagram frames={FrameState[]} heap={HeapObject[]} arrows={Ref[]} stepIndex={n} />` — driven entirely by declarative state per step.

**`EventLoopMachine`** (the flagship, M5)
- Fixed stage layout: CallStackTower (left), Web API waiting room (top right, hand-drawn timers/fetch clouds), macrotask conveyor (bottom), microtask express lane (above it, visibly shorter/faster), and a hand-drawn crank arm that only rotates to feed the stack when the tower is empty.
- Must correctly play: `setTimeout 0`, promise-vs-timeout ordering, blocked-stack scenarios, and eventually user code from the sandbox.

## Screen inventory (beyond lessons)
| Screen | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Curriculum map (home) | Compact journey map. Phases 0–1 elevated in a "start here — the foundation" section (user feedback: values/variables are THE building blocks). Cards show a plain-words teaser, not jargon |
| Phase page (`/phase/:n`) | Each phase's own "lab": plain-words intro (2–3 newbie-friendly paragraphs with an analogy), key-terms glossary on sticky notes, "after this phase you can…" list, lesson list, prev/next nav. Content in `src/content/phase-intros.ts`. User feedback: the map must itself teach — no expert one-liners |
| Lesson page | The 6-part anatomy above |
| Recall deck | Daily review of due cards; drawing prompts answered by revealing the original viz |
| Journal | All teach-back answers, editable — "your own textbook, written by you" |
| Sandbox (M4+) | CodeMirror + live MemoryDiagram/CallStackTower; seeded from lessons |
| Progress | Prediction accuracy per phase, streak, export/import |
