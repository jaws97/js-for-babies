      <p>
        The clean mental model: <strong>undefined is the machine’s nothing; null is the
        programmer’s nothing.</strong> undefined shows up uninvited in exact, predictable places:
        a declared-but-unassigned variable (you just saw it), a function that returns nothing
        (Phase 3), a missing property on an object, an off-the-end position of an array (Phase 4).
        null never appears on its own — if you see null, a human (or an API) put it there to say
        “this field is intentionally empty.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style={{ color: 'var(--color-marker-coral)', fontWeight: 700 }}>Gotcha! </span>
        Ask the machine <code>typeof null</code> and it answers… <code>"object"</code>. That is
        flatly wrong — null is its own primitive type — and it’s one of the most famous bugs in
        computing history: it slipped into the very first JavaScript engine in 1995, and by the
        time anyone could fix it, too many programs depended on it. It will never be fixed. Interviewers
        adore this question; now you have the story, not just the trivia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why testers care, concretely: API responses are full of nulls (
        <code>"middleName": null</code> means the field exists and is deliberately empty), while
        undefined typically means a field is <em>missing entirely</em> — and “empty on purpose”
        versus “forgot to include it” are different bugs with different fixes. Your future
        assertions will distinguish the two constantly. One preview for lesson 1.9:{' '}
        <code>null == undefined</code> is true, but <code>null === undefined</code> is false — the
        loose comparison considers the two nothings equal, the strict one knows better.

      'Explain to a friend: why does JavaScript have TWO kinds of “nothing”, and how would you decide whether a nothing you found is undefined or null territory?',
    modelAnswer:
      'JavaScript’s two nothings answer different questions. undefined is the machine’s nothing — it appears automatically when something was never set: a variable declared without a value, a missing field, a function that returned nothing. null is the programmer’s nothing — a human deliberately stored “empty” to say “this is intentionally blank,” like a person with no middle name. So when you meet a nothing: if nobody ever filled the box, it’s undefined; if someone filled it with an on-purpose blank, it’s null. In testing this matters constantly — an API field that’s null (deliberately empty) versus missing (undefined) are two different situations, and often two different bugs.',

    'undefined = the machine’s nothing: “never set.” It appears by itself, as a signal — you rarely write it.',
    'null = the programmer’s nothing: deliberately stored emptiness. And typeof null === "object" is a famous, permanent 1995 bug — great interview story.',
