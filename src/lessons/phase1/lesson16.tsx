      <p>
        A fact that will save you a debugging session someday: strings are{' '}
        <strong>immutable</strong> — the train can never be modified in place. You can’t swap car 0
        of "Ada" to make "Bda"; every string operation (uppercasing, trimming, gluing) builds a{' '}
        <em>brand-new train</em> and leaves the original untouched. So{' '}
        <code>name.toUpperCase()</code> hands you "ADA" as a new string — <code>name</code> itself
        still points at "Ada" until you reassign it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strings come with a rich toolbox attached (all reachable with the dot):{' '}
        <code>.toUpperCase()</code> / <code>.toLowerCase()</code>, <code>.trim()</code> (strips
        spaces from the ends — form input’s best friend), <code>.includes("da")</code> (is this
        aboard?), <code>.slice(0, 2)</code> (copy cars 0 up to but not including 2 → "Ad"). No need
        to memorize them today — recognize the pattern: <em>string, dot, tool</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why three kinds of quotes? <code>"double"</code> and <code>'single'</code> are identical —
        pick one, stay consistent. Backticks <code>`…`</code> are the upgrade: they allow{' '}
        <code>${'{expression}'}</code> slots (anything inside is <em>evaluated</em> — the rule from
        lesson 0.3 — so <code>`Total: ${'{2 + 3}'}`</code> becomes "Total: 5") and they can span
        multiple lines. For a future automation tester this is daily bread:{' '}
        <code>`Expected ${'{expected}'} but got ${'{actual}'}`</code> is the shape of every good
        failure message you’ll ever write.

      'A string is text stored as a train of characters, each car numbered — but the numbering starts at 0, so the first character is at position 0 and the last is at length minus 1. That’s just how computers count positions: “how many cars to skip from the start.” You can ask a string its .length, grab a car with [position], and glue trains with +. Backtick strings (`…`) are the modern upgrade: they contain ${…} slots where the machine evaluates whatever’s inside and splices the result into the text — so `Hi, ${name}!` builds "Hi, Ada!" automatically. Much easier to read than gluing pieces with +.',
