      <p>
        The proper vocabulary, worth owning: <code>let</code> is a <strong>keyword</strong> (a word
        reserved by the language), <code>age</code> is an <strong>identifier</strong> (a name you
        chose), <code>=</code> is the <strong>assignment operator</strong>, and the whole line is a{' '}
        <strong>declaration</strong> with an <strong>initial value</strong>. When someone says
        “declare a variable and initialize it to 25,” they mean exactly the three pictures you just
        watched: reserve a box, place a value, bind a name.
      </p>
      <p>
        That word <strong>bind</strong> is the precise one: the engine keeps a private table
        mapping names to boxes — “age → box #7,204” — and consults it every time a name appears.
        You never see the table, but knowing it exists explains so much: why a name used before
        it’s created gives a ReferenceError (nothing in the table yet!), and why two variables can
        hold the same value without being connected (two boxes, two labels).
      </p>
      <p>
        One honest disclosure, because this app never lies to you: “a labeled box holding the
        value” is 90% true, and it’s the right picture for numbers, strings and booleans. In Phase
        4 you’ll discover that for big things (objects, arrays), the box holds an <em>arrow</em> to
        the thing instead of the thing itself — and that upgrade explains the single most common
        bug family in JavaScript. The label-and-box picture you learned today is the foundation
        that upgrade stands on.

    modelAnswer:
      'When let age = 25 runs, the machine does three things: it borrows a box from memory, it puts the value 25 inside, and it ties the name “age” to that box like a label. So age isn’t the number and isn’t the box — it’s a label pointing at the box. Whenever the program uses age later, the machine follows the label, opens the box, and hands over whatever is inside. That’s why a variable can change (new contents, same label) and why using a name that was never created is an error — there’s no label with that name in the machine’s table.',
