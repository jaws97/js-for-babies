      <p>
        The formal execution order, worth having exactly right: <strong>init → check → body →
        update → check → body → update → … → check(false) → exit</strong>. Everything a for loop
        does, a while loop can do — for is purely a tidier arrangement, keeping the counter’s
        birth, boundary and change in one glanceable line. That tidiness is real protection: the
        “forgot the update” infinite loop from lesson 2.5 is nearly impossible in a for loop,
        because the update slot stares at you from the header.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two idioms to absorb now: counting from zero (<code>let i = 0; i &lt; n</code> — five laps,
        i taking 0,1,2,3,4) is the standard because it matches string and array positions; and{' '}
        <code>i++</code> (“increment”) is the universal shorthand for <code>i = i + 1</code>{' '}
        (<code>i--</code> counts down). In your automation future, for loops drive data-driven
        tests: “for each of these 50 usernames, run the login test” — one body, fifty laps, and
        the counter tells you exactly which lap failed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong style={{ color: 'var(--color-marker-coral)' }}>Fun fact:</strong> why is the
        counter always called <code>i</code>? The habit predates JavaScript by four decades — it
        comes from FORTRAN (1957), one of the first programming languages ever, where variables
        beginning with the letters I through N were automatically integers. Counters became i,
        then j and k for nested ones… and 70 years later, programmers who’ve never seen a line of
        FORTRAN still write <code>let i = 0</code> by pure cultural inheritance. (And i itself
        stands for the mathematician’s <em>index</em>.)

      'A for loop packs the counter pattern into three labeled slots: for (init; check; update). Init runs exactly once — it creates the counter. Then the machine cycles: check the condition; if true, run the body, then run the update, then check again. So for five laps, the check actually runs six times — five yeses and the final no that ends the loop (checks = laps + 1, the root of off-by-one bugs). It’s the same engine as a while loop, just with the counter’s whole life — birth, boundary, change — visible in one line, which is why you can’t accidentally forget the update and freeze the tab. Fun fact: counters are called i because FORTRAN made I-through-N variables integers in 1957, and the habit never died.',
