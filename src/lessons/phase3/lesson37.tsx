      <p>
        The precise definition: a <strong>closure</strong> is a function together with its{' '}
        <strong>lexical environment</strong> — the set of outer variables that were in scope where
        the function was <em>defined</em> (not where it’s called). When the engine sees an inner
        function referencing an outer variable, it keeps that variable alive on the heap instead
        of destroying it with the stack frame. The inner function “closes over” the variable —
        hence the name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two facts worth engraving: closures capture the <em>variable</em>, not a snapshot of its
        value — that’s why count keeps advancing. And each call to the outer function creates a{' '}
        <em>new</em> environment: <code>makeCounter()</code> twice gives two independent counters
        with two private counts. This combination — persistent + private — is how JavaScript did
        “private state” for decades before classes got <code>#private</code> fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        For your testing future: closures are why a Playwright helper like{' '}
        <code>makeLogin(page)</code> can hand back a function that still knows which page it
        belongs to, no matter where it’s called from. Backpacks everywhere.

      'Explain closures to a friend with the backpack picture — including why lesson 3.2’s "slots die with the call" rule has this exception, and why two counters from the same factory never share a count.',
    modelAnswer:
      'Normally, when a function finishes, its variables are destroyed with its stack frame — that’s 3.2’s rule. The exception: if the function RETURNS an inner function, and that inner function uses the outer variables, the inner function walks away wearing a backpack containing those variables — the living variables themselves, not copies. So makeCounter() creates count, hands back a little machine holding count in its backpack, and even after makeCounter’s frame is gone, every call to the machine opens the backpack, updates count, and remembers it for next time. Nothing outside can touch the backpack — scope’s one-way glass makes it private. And every call to the factory sews a brand-new backpack, which is why two counters made by the same factory count independently. That bundle — function plus remembered birthplace variables — is a closure.',

    'A closure = a function wearing a backpack of the variables from where it was BORN. They stay alive after the outer call dies.',
    'The backpack holds the living variable, not a copy — that’s why count keeps advancing between calls.',
    'Every factory call sews a fresh backpack: two counters never share state. Persistent AND private.',
    'The debt from 3.2 is paid: slots die with the call — UNLESS a returned inner function carries them away.',
