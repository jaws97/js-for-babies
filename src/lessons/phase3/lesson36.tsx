        In 3.3 you saw the engine <em>jump</em> into a function and jump back. But here’s the
        question that makes everything tick: when <code>makeTea()</code> calls{' '}
        <code>boilWater()</code>, and boilWater finishes… how does the engine know{' '}
        <HighlightMark type="highlight" color="color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-marker-yellow) 45%, transparent)">
          exactly where to go back to
        </HighlightMark>
        ? Not roughly — exactly: the right function, the right line, with all its variables intact.
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer is a beautifully simple machine called the <strong>call stack</strong>: a tower
        of paper cards. Every call places a new card on top; every finished call removes the top
        card — and the card underneath still says exactly where its function was paused. Watch the
        tower breathe.

        The real vocabulary: each card is a <strong>stack frame</strong> — it holds the function’s
        parameters, its local variables, and the <strong>return address</strong> (the exact spot
        to resume). The stack is LIFO — <em>last in, first out</em> — like a stack of plates: you
        can only add or remove at the top. One frame per <em>call</em>, not per function: call the
        same function twice and it gets two separate frames (lesson 3.9 turns this into a
        superpower).
      </p>
      <p>
        The stack also explains the phrase <em>single-threaded</em> from lesson 2.5 more deeply:
        JavaScript has exactly ONE call stack, so exactly one top card, so exactly one thing
        running at any instant. And the stack has a maximum height — call too deep without
        finishing anything and the engine throws{' '}
        <code>RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded</code>.

        <strong>Stack Overflow</strong> got its name. The place every programmer on Earth goes to
        ask questions is named after the error you just learned to cause. You’ll visit it roughly

      'Every time a function is called, the engine puts a new card on a tower — the call stack. The card holds that call’s variables and, crucially, the exact line it’s on. Whatever card is on top is the code currently running. If that function calls another one, it freezes mid-line, its card stays put, and a new card goes on top. When the top function finishes, its card is removed and destroyed — and the card underneath is on top again, still pointing at the exact spot where it paused, so the engine resumes precisely there. Push on call, pop on finish, only the top runs. That’s also why error messages list several functions — that’s the tower printed out, called a stack trace — and why calling too deep gives a “stack overflow”: the tower has a maximum height.',
