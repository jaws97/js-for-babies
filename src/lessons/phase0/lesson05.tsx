        Learning to read errors calmly is a superpower — and for a future tester it’s doubly true:

      <p>
        Meet the big three error categories — between them they cover most of what you’ll see for
        months. <strong>SyntaxError</strong>: “I couldn’t even read this” — the grammar is broken
        (a missing quote or bracket), so the program doesn’t start at all.{' '}
        <strong>ReferenceError</strong>: “you used a name that doesn’t exist anywhere” — like{' '}
        <code>consoel.log(…)</code> or using a variable you never created.{' '}
        <strong>TypeError</strong>: “that thing exists, but it can’t do what you asked” — like our{' '}
        <code>console.lgo</code> (console exists; lgo isn’t something inside it you can call).
      </p>
      <p>
        Real errors usually come with extra lines underneath, called a <strong>stack trace</strong>{' '}
        — a list of “who called whom” leading to the failure. It looks scary and is actually a
        breadcrumb trail; it becomes genuinely useful once you know functions (Phase 3), and we’ll
        read them together then. Until that day: <em>the first line is the letter, the rest is the
        envelope.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Two professional habits to start now. First: when several errors appear,{' '}
        <strong>read the first one</strong> — later errors are often just fallout from it. Second:
        errors are evidence, not verdicts. Your future job description literally includes making
        software fail on purpose and reading what it says — a tester who reads error messages
        calmly and precisely is worth their weight in gold.

      'An error isn’t the computer saying “you failed” — it’s the machine stopping to ask for help, with a note attached. The note has three parts: the category (like TypeError — what kind of problem), the message (what it couldn’t do, in its own words), and the location (the exact line where it got stuck). Everything before that line already ran; everything after never did. So: read the category, read the message slowly, go to the line it points at, fix, and run again. The red text isn’t the wall — it’s the map.',

  recap: [
    'An error = the machine asking for help: a category, a message, and the exact line. Read it like a letter, not an alarm.',
