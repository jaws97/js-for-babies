      <p>
        The proper word for “the machine carries out an instruction” is <strong>execute</strong>.
        Programmers say “the code executes” or “this line runs” — same thing: the machine did what
        the instruction said.
      </p>
      <p>
        A processor doesn’t understand English — or even JavaScript. Deep down it only understands{' '}
        <strong>machine code</strong>: unimaginably tiny steps like “copy this number over there.”
        Something has to translate your JavaScript into those tiny steps — that translator is the{' '}
        <strong>engine</strong>, and it’s the star of the next lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
        About speed: a modern processor performs <strong>billions</strong> of those tiny steps per
        second. That’s the entire trade: the machine brings speed and perfect obedience; you bring
        the thinking. Programming is deciding <em>exactly</em> what should happen — because the
        machine will never fill in a gap for you. “Make it look nice” is not an instruction it can
        execute; that vagueness is precisely why programming languages exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        One more property, and it’s the foundation of your future career: programs are{' '}
        <strong>deterministic</strong> — the same program, given the same starting conditions, does
        the same thing every single time. That reliability is what makes automated testing possible
        at all: a test can check the same promise a thousand times and mean it.

      'A program is a list of instructions written down in advance for the computer to follow — like a recipe for a cook who obeys perfectly but never thinks. The computer does instruction 1, then 2, then 3, always in order, billions of steps per second.
