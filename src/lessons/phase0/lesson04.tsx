        The machine executes millions of instructions per second — but here’s the catch: by itself,
        each instruction is instantly forgotten. For a program to do anything useful, it needs

        page you’re on.

        What’s actually inside a box? A tiny number — that’s all memory can physically hold. One box
        (a <strong>byte</strong>) stores a number from 0 to 255. Everything else is built from
        those numbers by agreement: the letter <code>A</code> is stored as 65, colors as three
        numbers (red, green, blue), sound as thousands of numbers per second. Text, photos, games —{' '}
        <em>all of it is numbers in boxes</em>. That’s honestly the entire secret of computers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two-tier system has real names: <strong>RAM</strong> (the workbench — fast, small-ish,
        wiped when power stops; your laptop has maybe 8–16 GB, billions of boxes) and{' '}
        <strong>storage/disk</strong> (the cupboard — much bigger, much slower, permanent; where
        files live). A program constantly pulls things from the cupboard onto the workbench, works
        on them there, and must deliberately put results back if it wants to keep them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the good news for you specifically: in JavaScript, <strong>you will never juggle box
        addresses yourself</strong>. The engine picks the boxes, tracks them, and even sweeps up the
        ones you no longer need (a janitor called the <strong>garbage collector</strong> — you’ll
        properly meet it in Phase 5). What YOU get to do is attach <em>names</em> to boxes — and
        that, exactly that, is what a variable is. Which is the very next phase.

      'A computer has two kinds of memory. RAM is like a workbench: while a program runs, it keeps everything it’s working on there, in billions of tiny numbered boxes, because grabbing things from the workbench is instant. The disk is like a cupboard: much bigger and permanent, but slower. The workbench gets cleared every time a program ends or the power goes — that’s why unsaved work vanishes in a crash. Saving means deliberately copying your work from the workbench into the cupboard, where it survives.',
